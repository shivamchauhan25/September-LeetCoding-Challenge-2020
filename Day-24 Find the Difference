Find the Difference

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.




Solution:
Python:

class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        from collections import Counter
        occ_s=Counter(s)
        occ_t=Counter(t)
        for i in occ_t.keys():
            if i not in occ_s.keys() or occ_s[i]!=occ_t[i]:
                return i
